When we see a amazing dish from a great restaurant, we might wonder how can we make this delicacy by ourselves. With this motivation, I created a food recipe generator that takes in the photo of that specific dish and outputs the recipe to recreate that dish! However, people gets lazy sometimes. Hence, I also designed an UI to track the nearest restaurant locations that contains that dish!
