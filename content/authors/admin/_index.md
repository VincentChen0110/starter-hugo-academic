I am a research assistant in the institute of information science in Academia Sinica! I am currently conducting research in the NLPSA lab. My research interests include deep learning and natural language processing. I am currently working on to create coherent and fun text (e.g., stories) based on an image stream. Also, I aim to create a general metric for Natural Language Generation to evaluate the true quality of generated text!
