I have great interests in musical instruments. Which includes play the piano, violin, and guitar. I started playing piano since I was 4 and competed in numerous competitions. In high school and college, I turned into a keyboardist and vocalist to play in bands and perform on various stages. Now I am mainly playing guitar in my free time and write some easy songs. Below is pictures of me playing on stage!
